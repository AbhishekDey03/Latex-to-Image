# Latex-to-Image
A piece of code created to turn drawings made with a mouse into a viable tikz image.

This code was created whilst on my summer internship studying Dark Matter in Semi-Visible Leptonic jets. due to this, there are features that are skewed to include such premade items such as a cone, or arrows. If any other material is required, please reach out.
